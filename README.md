# NOLA Neighborhood Annotation

I wrote this script after reading [Jeff Asher's blog post](https://nolacrimenews.com/2016/07/30/another-terrific-update-to-data-nola-gov/).
He mentioned that it was hard to segment the call for service data by neighborhood given just the lat, lng.
This script adds a new column to the data with the neighborhood name of the origin call using the neighborhood boundaries
[from this dataset](https://data.nola.gov/Geographic-Base-Layers/NOLA-Neighborhood-Statistical-Areas/ukvx-5dku).

I have the provided the [annotated 2016 data](data/calls_for_service/2016_annotated.csv) as an example
but this will work with the other years as well. This can also be adapted to work with any type of data.
If you want me to run it on some new data for you, please file file an issue.

## Setup

You'll need `python` and `pip`. This will depend on your system.

Run pip on the requirements file to get the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example Usage

The `annotate.py` script takes a csv file for input and outputs a new csv file with the new `Neighborhood` column.
It streams the new rows into the output file one at a time.

```
$ python annotate.py data/calls_for_service/2016.csv output.csv
